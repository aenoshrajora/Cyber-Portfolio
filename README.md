## About this project

This website portfolio is designed with a hacker-themed aesthetic, perfectly suited for a cybersecurity professional or ethical hacker. The dark background and green monospace font give it a classic hacker-inspired look reminiscent of terminal windows and command-line interfaces.

The portfolio showcases my experience and achievements in the cybersecurity domain, including internships, research projects, and certifications. The sections are cleverly named with Linux terminal commands, such as $ cat 'Experience', $ echo 'Education', and $ ls 'Skills', adding a playful and authentic touch to the hacker theme. Feel free to change according to your needs. 

The website features a side menu for easy navigation, and the main content area is organized into sections that highlight work experience, education, skills, CTF (Capture the Flag) achievements, projects, interests, and certifications. The skills section displays an extensive list of programming languages and cybersecurity tools, including popular tools like Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit, and various forensics and malware analysis tools.

The portfolio also incorporates a background video, likely depicting a simulation or visualization related to cybersecurity or hacking, further enhancing the overall theme. A widget displaying a real-time cyber threat map from Kaspersky is included, showcasing keen interest and involvement in cybersecurity.

Overall, this hacker-themed portfolio presents a unique and engaging way for a cybersecurity professional to showcase their skills, experience, and achievements, while staying true to the aesthetics and culture of the hacking community.
